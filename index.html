						<h2>Mission</h2>
						<p>eGaaS’s main mission is to free people, business and governments from routine bureaucratic procedures and to serve as a tool that could be used to organize any activity and exercise control over that activity without documents circulation. eGaaS is aimed at illuminating the shadow niche in which the modern financial and political systems reside. eGaaS should become the platform on which the State and business structures of all countries should function harmoniously for the benefit of the citizens.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-8">
						<h2>Technology</h2>
						<p>eGaaS performs four basic functions required for efficient transfer of most types of government and business activities into blockchain technology: financial system, registry structure, smart contract algorithm and smart law formation and execution mechanism. The financial system secures transactions in the currency of a particular country. Smart contracts automatically implement the algorithm of deals involving registry objects and with possible fiat-currency transactions. Smart laws regulate the creation and implementation of smart contracts and automatically regulate relations between individuals and organizations in all areas of government activity.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<h2>Government</h2>
					<p>Each State independently sets the structure of its state organs, establishes its governance and principles of relations between citizens and institutions. eGaaS only regulates the protocols for confirming and recording data in the registries of governments, provides templates of basic smart laws and supports their adoption and implementation mechanism.</p>
				</div>

						</div>
					</div>
					<h2>Legislation</h2>
					<p>All state laws, whose subjects are the objects listed in the eGaaS blockchain registries, are transferred into smart law format. Smart laws are directly effective laws. Implementing them does not require intermediaries or regulatory authorities. Amendments and changes made to them take effect immediately. Many of the functions of government bodies – such as registration of civil status (birth, marriage, and divorce), taxation, regulation of financial and business relations and many others – are automatically performed and controlled by eGaaS smart laws.</p>

					</div>
					<h2>Voting</h2>
					<p>In eGaaS, citizens can be reliably identified, thus simplifying election procedures – special smart laws prescribe the period and conditions of elections, accept applications from candidates, launch the voting procedure and count the votes. Voting by means of electronic keys is quick and incurs minimum cost. Voting results, that are stored in the blockchain, can hardly be tampered with.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<h2>Finance</h2>
					<p>For a State to join the common blockchain platform, it needs to first open eGaaS accounts for all individuals and legal entities in its Central Bank. From this point onwards, all financial transactions – from buying of goods in the shop to execution of state budget – will be conducted under the control of smart laws. Any financial obligations (repayment of loan, insurance payout, payment of bills) are secured via smart contracts and are executed automatically. eGaaS protocols easily and reliably implement p2p lending procedures.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<h2>Common registry</h2>
					<p>Smart laws and smart contracts can function efficiently only if maximum number of registries is transferred to the eGaaS platform: registries of natural persons and legal entities, of property, of copyrights, inventions, etc. Needless to say that blockchain technology would greatly enhance registry security against manipulation and fraud.</p>

					<h2>Medicine</h2>
					<p>eGaaS keeps all medical records, medical recommendations, diagnoses, etc. of each person, while maintaining anonymity of data. Because of this, each person can receive effective treatment anywhere in the world. At the same time, medical science and pharmacology obtain unique statistical information that would take diagnosis and prescription of treatment to an entirely new level.</p>

					</div>
					<h2>Business</h2>
					<p>eGaaS is a complete tool for effective business operations. It contains a common structure of registries (companies, products, licenses, etc.), whose objects are used when drawing up smart contracts. The smart law system secures automatic deduction of taxes, customs duties and other charges.</p>

					</div>
					<h2>Social protection</h2>
					<p>Keeping records of the income and medical data of citizens would allow the government, or more precisely, a special smart law, to optimally implement social support in the form of disability pensions, various allowances and benefits. The state pension system is also implemented on the basis of smart laws, which automatically allocates social tax, calculates pensions and starts paying them when the citizen reaches a retirement age.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<h2>Registration of companies</h2>
					<p>Any citizen (subject to limitations prescribed by the smart laws of the State) can from his or her device register a company by selecting one of the kinds of organizations proposed by legislation. After registering the company, the owner can immediately issue shares and apply for loan all from the same device. One can easily implement crowdfunding campaigns on the Egaas smart contracts – with target use of funds controlled.</p>

					<h2>Citizen</h2>
					<p>eGaaS radically changes people's daily lives, freeing them from the need to prepare and store a lot of documents. Every activity in the past that usually required your signature on paper (such as marriage, utilities contract, real estate purchase, wills and so forth) would now be recorded and automatically implemented by smart laws or smart contracts after signing them with an electronic key.</p>

					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p>eGaaS provides a common environment for organization and recording of educational activities. Students will forever turn the page on record book, while teachers will no longer need work sheets and schedules: every academic performance data are securely stored in the blockchain.</p>
					<p>It would be fundamentally impossible to falsify education details – degree certificates will no longer be in a paper format, but in the form of a record in Egaas, signed with the keys of thesis/dissertation committee members.</p>
