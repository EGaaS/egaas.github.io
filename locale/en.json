		"PLATFORM": {
			"HEAD": "Platform for business and communities",
			"TEXT": "eGaaS is technically a blockchain platform featuring a mechanism for creation and execution of smart contracts and smart laws. So, before States are connected to it, the platform can still be used to create a variety of financial, business and social applications, such as payment systems, exchanges, insurance and credit institutions, accounting and management systems in all spheres, from trade to medicine. eGaaS facilitates the creation of flexible custom applications with multiple smart contract features. Common rules and conditions for implementation of individual smart contracts are entered as smart laws. The eGaaS platform is a handy tool for organizing the activities of communities. It allows to establish the rules of relations between members and to conduct voting. That is, before the first States move over to eGaaS, the platform will be widely used in business and in social activities.",

		"WHY": {

			"TEXT1": "EGS tokens ensure security of the eGaaS platform and working capacity of its nodes: opening of new tables, adding attributes, connecting and performing smart contracts and smart laws are paid for in EGS. Therefore, private and corporate users of the platform, as well as states will have to buy EGS to secure the working capacity of their eGaaS projects. Hence, the need for EGS tokens will inevitably grow, which, considering the exclusion of additional releases, will increase their exchange rate.",
			"TEXT2": "It is inevitable that obsolete forms of governance will die off, while governments will be transformed into e-services for citizens. Do not miss the chance to participate in this revolutionary project in the first stages of development."

			"TEXT3": "v 0.x – unstable and so works on private blockchains; it can be used on your PC or local network; it allows to create eGaaS nodes, etc.",
			"TEXT4": "In v 0.x, with creation of new and modification of existing tables, pages, menus, and smart contracts of eGaaS, you can configure a state or community to your requirements.",
			"TEXT5": "In the near future, we will add embedded applications (sets of smart contracts, smart laws, tables, pages, menus) in the 0.x version based on which it will be possible to – in a few clicks – create interstate unions, monetary unions, central banks, registries, exchanges and so forth.",
			"TEXT6": "In the future, the 0.x and 1.x versions will be merged after which v 1.x will have all the features of version 0.x – instead of private blockchains there will be a common blockchain. All the countries and communities will be able to interact with each other, and will use EGS tokens for network protection."
