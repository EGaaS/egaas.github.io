So, before States are connected to it, the platform can still be used to create a variety of financial, business and social applications, such as payment systems, exchanges, insurance and credit institutions, accounting and management systems in all spheres, from trade to medicine. eGaaS facilitates the creation of flexible custom applications with multiple smart contract features. Common rules and conditions for implementation of individual smart contracts are entered as smart laws. The eGaaS platform is a handy tool for organizing the activities of communities. It allows to establish the rules of relations between members and to conduct voting. That is, before the first States move over to eGaaS, the platform will be widely used in business and in social activities.",
