The financial system secures transactions in the currency of a particular country. Smart contracts automatically implement the algorithm of deals involving registry objects and with possible fiat-currency transactions. Smart laws regulate the creation and implementation of smart contracts and automatically regulate relations between individuals and organizations in all areas of government activity.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="zebra"><div id="about" class="page"></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="article col-md-6"><div class="head"><div class="icon"><img src="images/i_01.svg" alt></div></div><h2>Government</h2><p>Each State independently sets the structure of its state organs, establishes its governance and principles of relations between citizens and institutions. eGaaS only regulates the protocols for confirming and recording data in the registries of governments, provides templates of basic smart laws and supports their adoption and implementation mechanism.</p></div><div class="article col-md-6"><div class="head"><div class="icon"><img src="images/i_02.svg" alt></div></div><h2>Legislation</h2><p>All state laws, whose subjects are the objects listed in the eGaaS blockchain registries, are transferred into smart law format. Smart laws are directly effective laws. Implementing them does not require intermediaries or regulatory authorities. Amendments and changes made to them take effect immediately. Many of the functions of government bodies – such as registration of civil status (birth, marriage, and divorce), taxation, regulation of financial and business relations and many others – are automatically performed and controlled by eGaaS smart laws.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="zebra"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="article col-md-6"><div class="head"><div class="icon"><img src="images/i_03.svg" alt></div></div><h2>Voting</h2><p>In eGaaS, citizens can be reliably identified, thus simplifying election procedures – special smart laws prescribe the period and conditions of elections, accept applications from candidates, launch the voting procedure and count the votes. Voting by means of electronic keys is quick and incurs minimum cost. Voting results, that are stored in the blockchain, can hardly be tampered with.</p></div><div class="article col-md-6"><div class="head"><div class="icon"><img src="images/i_04.svg" alt></div></div><h2>Finance</h2><p>For a State to join the common blockchain platform, it needs to first open eGaaS accounts for all individuals and legal entities in its Central Bank. From this point onwards, all financial transactions – from buying of goods in the shop to execution of state budget – will be conducted under the control of smart laws. Any financial obligations (repayment of loan, insurance payout, payment of bills) are secured via smart contracts and are executed automatically. eGaaS protocols easily and reliably implement p2p lending procedures.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="zebra"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="article col-md-6"><div class="head"><div class="icon"><img src="images/i_05.svg" alt></div></div><h2>Common registry</h2><p>Smart laws and smart contracts can function efficiently only if maximum number of registries is transferred to the eGaaS platform: registries of natural persons and legal entities, of property, of copyrights, inventions, etc. Needless to say that blockchain technology would greatly enhance registry security against manipulation and fraud.</p></div><div class="article col-md-6"><div class="head"><div class="icon"><img src="images/i_06.svg" alt></div></div><h2>Medicine</h2><p>eGaaS keeps all medical records, medical recommendations, diagnoses, etc. of each person, while maintaining anonymity of data. Because of this, each person can receive effective treatment anywhere in the world. At the same time, medical science and pharmacology obtain unique statistical information that would take diagnosis and prescription of treatment to an entirely new level.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="zebra"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="article col-md-6"><div class="head"><div class="icon"><img src="images/i_07.svg" alt></div></div><h2>Business</h2><p>eGaaS is a complete tool for effective business operations. It contains a common structure of registries (companies, products, licenses, etc.), whose objects are used when drawing up smart contracts. The smart law system secures automatic deduction of taxes, customs duties and other charges.</p></div><div class="article col-md-6"><div class="head"><div class="icon"><img src="images/i_08.svg" alt></div></div><h2>Social protection</h2><p>Keeping records of the income and medical data of citizens would allow the government, or more precisely, a special smart law, to optimally implement social support in the form of disability pensions, various allowances and benefits. The state pension system is also implemented on the basis of smart laws, which automatically allocates social tax, calculates pensions and starts paying them when the citizen reaches a retirement age.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="zebra"></div><div class="team"><div id="team" class="page"></div><div class="container"><div class="inner"><h2>Team</h2><div class="row"><article><img src="images/team_01.png" alt><div><h3>Oleg Strelenko <span>Funder, CEO, Blockchain developer</span><aside id="team_particles"></aside></h3><p>Blockchain developer with 5 years of work experience.
